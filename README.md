GRAIN ATM – Smart Grain Distribution System
�
Overview
GRAIN ATM is an innovative, IoT-enabled solution designed to modernize the distribution of grains and essentials for ration card holders. By combining RFID technology, automation, and microcontrollers, this system ensures efficient, transparent, and tamper-proof grain distribution in government-supported schemes.
This project demonstrates practical problem-solving skills, electronics and coding expertise, and a real-world application of technology for social impact.


Features
RFID-Based Authentication: Only authorized users can access the ATM using their RFID-enabled ration card.
Automated Grain Dispensing: Servo-controlled system releases the allocated grain quantity accurately.
LCD Display Interface: Provides clear instructions and real-time status updates.
Audit and Tracking: Keeps a record of all transactions for transparency.
Low-Cost & Scalable: Designed for easy deployment in rural and urban settings.
